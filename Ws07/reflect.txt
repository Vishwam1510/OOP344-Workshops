Workshop 07 has taught me several things such as copying data from a file into a sequential container, and then also use the numeric library to accumulate data values moreover the lamda expression to specify an operation on each value in a data set. This all as suggested by the workshop was done by me and I got a thorough lesson through this workshop. This workshop was smaller than the previous workshops done by me yet it was interesting as the concepts included in this workshops were new to me. There were some issues faced by me which were some small errors, but they were easy to overcome and my output was successfully matched. Hence, this workshop was a good exercise on how to copy a data from a file into a container, a sequential container.
