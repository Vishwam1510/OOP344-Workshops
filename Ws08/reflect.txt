Workshop 8 was a challenging workshop as compared to previous workshops and milestone, as this involved dealing with quadratic complexity. While, I was struggling with this workshop a little, I decided to go through the notes as there were many problems whose answers I didn't know, hence when I took thorough knowledge from the notes, I got better understanding about this workshop which helped me clear this thing as soon as possible. I also learnt how to use a smart pointer to move an object in this workshop which was an interesting topic itself. All in all, there was a lot to learn from this workshop and it gave me a good knowledge about many new topics covered in workshop 8 such as the advantage of smart pointer syntax. Also, learning the difference betwen raw and smart pointer syntax in my solution.
