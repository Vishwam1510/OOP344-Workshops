Workshop 06 has taught me how to manage polymorphic objects using the vector container, adding to that topic I also learned how to move a dynamically allocated object into a container which was a tough task to do, there were many issues faced by me while covering that topic, yet I found soultions to those errors and learnt a good topic out of it. Moreover, I learnt how to report and handle an exception. We had to deal with multiple files in workshop 6 which was a little bit confusing but was not that tough. The main reason for deallocating dynamically allocated memory is to prevent memory leak which is the core reason. Memory leak is an issue, hence one should always deallocate the dynamically allocated memory. All in all, there was a lot to learn from this workshop.
