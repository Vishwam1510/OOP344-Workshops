The workshop 3 taught me how to deal with queue which works on first in first out method. Working on queue model was exciting as it was the first time we dealt with queue and it was interesting as well. Specializing push() member function was necessary as it will push a new element wherever needed and also see if the queue is full or not and act accordingly. Moreover, it included dealing with a template class which was challenging as well. All in all dealing with workshop 03 was interesting and the queue module was the challenging part where some issues were faced by me but was later recovererd as well.
