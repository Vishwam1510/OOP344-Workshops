Workshop 9 taught me how to deal with Multi-Threading in C++, it was a good topic to learn, there were some challenges faced by me while learning the new topics such as processing partitioned data on two or more threads, write a set of characters to a file in a binary mode and bind a function to its arguments which were depicted in the learning outcomes of this workshop. I dealt with binary files, packaging tasks and many more things. All in all, this workshop was a good c++ topic to learn.
