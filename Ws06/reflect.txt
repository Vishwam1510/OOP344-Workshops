Workshop 05 involved dealing with more of dynamic memories where we have to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory using class templates. Moreover, I learnt how to code a lambda expression in this workshop which was an interesting thing to learn. Talking about some errors I faced, as creating a lambda expression was a toug topic. Hence, after going through notes I recoded the expression and after throwing some exceptions i finally came to a conclusion and was able to resolve all the errors related to that topic. All in all, this workshop was little challenging than the previous one when we have to deal with class templates with some specialization, but it was a good thing to go through it and learn it thoroughly and it also made my concept of template more clear.
